From the paper "A Primer on the Signature Method in Machine Learning" we propose the use case for modeling option pricing using the signature method and Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network.
We can choose an API that contributes historical option price time-series data, and use our LSTM to learn the patterns in the option data.

1. We apply the signature method to see our patterns and key parts.
2. We can then split the data into training/testing.
3. We then incorporate the LSTM network to analyze the movements of price, and find accuracy.

This can be performed in Pytorch for the (RNN) LSTM.

It may be redundant to use both the Signature Method and LSTM.

We can compare our accuracy with use of the black-scholes method of options pricing, and train on seperate new data to test.
